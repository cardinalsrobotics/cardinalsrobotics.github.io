    <h2>Courses</h2>
    <p>This year, we are offering a number of different courses, ran completely by volunteers, and member of our robotics team.</p>
    <p>Why are we doing this? We are doing this as part of our ongoing commitment to the community, and as a fundraiser for our team so we can continue to compete for years to come.</p>
    <h2>What is offered?</h2>
    <p>We are offering a wide variety of courses this year, most are still being worked on and will hopefully be available in Semester 2 (January / February) but we thought it would be good to get a few out here now!</p>

    <h3>Music Instrumental</h3>
    <p>Ever wanted to rock out on the drums? Listen to the soft symphonies of the flute? Look no further than Instrumental Music. A self-paced course where you learn an Instrument
        and meet lots of really cool people. This will be the <strong>least lame</strong> band class you'll ever take. Our repetoire is currently unselected, and will be decided by <strong> you</strong>!
    </p>
    <p>This course will be done virtually, with the occasional practice in-person, the physical meeting place has not be set up yet and currently everything will be done online.</p>
    <p>This is a beginner course, however experience is helpful. You can rent an instrument at Long and McQuade for a month to a year, or you can use your own. We would prefer to keep this as a normal concert band setup, but if you would like to use a different instrument
        please contact the director of the course via email.
