    <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
    <p>
      We are <strong>Bishop Carroll High School</strong> in Calgary, Alberta. Our school follows a unique self-guided 
      learning approach that encourages students to pursue their personal interests. This year, we are excited to launch a 
      <strong>FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) team</strong> to offer students hands-on learning experiences in Science, 
      Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM).
    </p>
    <p>This is our rookie year, and we are working hard to build and compete with our robot at the international level. We need your support to make it happen!</p>

    <h2>What is FIRST Robotics?</h2>
    <p>
      FIRST Robotics is a global competition where high school students design, build, and program semi-autonomous robots 
      to compete with other teams worldwide. Over a six-week period, students engage in engineering activities like:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Designing and Prototyping</li>
      <li>Wiring and Coding</li>
      <li>Testing and Evaluating</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Itâ€™s a thrilling experience that challenges students while fostering teamwork, problem-solving, and creativity.</p>

    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Robot parts and supplies</li>
      <li>Competition fees</li>
      <li>Accommodation and meals for out-of-town competitions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Our Community Involvement</h2>
    <p>
      In addition to competing, we are committed to promoting STEM education within our community. We plan to host school visits 
      to showcase our robots and lead activities using LEGO EV3 kits. We will also organize community competitions to inspire the 
      next generation of students to explore STEM fields.
